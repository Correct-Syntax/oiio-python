# oiio-python

OpenImageIO Python 3.x package to provide wheels for Linux. Friendly fork of [oiio-python](https://github.com/fredrikaverpil/oiio-python).

## Status

Not working, yet. :(

## Usage

- Install the wheel: `pip install ...`
- From within Python, import OpenImageIO: `from oiio import OpenImageIO as oiio`

See the `tests` folder for code examples used to test the built wheels' functionality.

## Notes

The Official OpenImageIO repository is at [OpenImageIO/oiio](https://github.com/OpenImageIO/oiio)
